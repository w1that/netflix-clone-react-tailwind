# netflix-clone-react-tailwind
 
2 pages of netflix clone I made when I was starting to learn tailwind css, which I've been thinking about for a long time. (welcomepage and loginpage). I learned the topic it helped, and because I had enough ideas, I finished it in two pages. I'm thinking of using it later.
